          <li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong> A subset of AI that allows systems to automatically improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It includes algorithms like decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks that allow machines to learn patterns from data.</li>
          <li><strong>Data Visualization:</strong> The process of representing data in graphical formats such as charts, graphs, and dashboards to help individuals make sense of large datasets quickly. Tools like Tableau, Power BI, and Python’s Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries are often used to create insightful visualizations.</li>
          <li><strong>Big Data:</strong> Involves the collection, storage, and analysis of massive datasets. Big Data techniques enable data scientists to handle and analyze large amounts of data that traditional methods cannot manage. Technologies such as Hadoop, Spark, and NoSQL databases are crucial in Big Data analysis.</li>
          <li><strong>Statistical Modeling:</strong> Uses statistical methods to build mathematical models that can describe the underlying structure of data. These models can then be used for prediction, forecasting, and hypothesis testing in various domains such as finance, healthcare, and economics.</li>
          <li><strong>Data Engineering:</strong> Involves the creation and management of infrastructure and tools for handling and processing data. Data engineers focus on building data pipelines, integrating data sources, and ensuring that data is accessible for analysis and modeling.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These areas often overlap, and data scientists typically use a combination of these methods to solve real-world problems.</p>
