        <h2>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that focuses on creating systems capable of performing tasks that would typically require human intelligence. These tasks include reasoning, problem-solving, decision-making, learning from experience, and understanding natural language. AI systems can process large volumes of data at speeds far beyond human capabilities, allowing them to identify patterns, predict outcomes, and make decisions with remarkable accuracy. While AI is not new, the advancements in computational power and access to vast amounts of data have enabled AI technologies to flourish in ways previously thought impossible.</p>
        <p>AI can be categorized into two primary types: narrow AI and general AI. Narrow AI, also known as weak AI, refers to systems designed to handle specific tasks. These systems are incredibly efficient at performing their designated functions but cannot generalize their abilities to other tasks. Examples include voice assistants like Siri or Alexa, which excel in specific tasks such as answering questions or playing music but are not capable of broader human-like cognitive functions. In contrast, general AI is an advanced form of AI that aims to replicate human-like intelligence, enabling machines to perform any cognitive task that a human can. While general AI is still a concept, its potential for shaping industries and transforming society is vast and warrants extensive research and development.</p>
