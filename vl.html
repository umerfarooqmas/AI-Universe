        <h2>What is Data Visualization?</h2>
        <p>Data visualization is the practice of transforming raw data into visual formats such as charts, graphs, dashboards, and maps. Instead of reading rows of numbers, visualization allows users to quickly understand complex information by seeing relationships, trends, and comparisons visually.</p>
        <p>By using visual elements like colors, shapes, and spatial positioning, data visualization makes large datasets more accessible and meaningful. It plays a critical role in data analysis, business intelligence, scientific research, and decision-making across industries.</p>

        <h2>Importance of Data Visualization</h2>
        <p>In today’s data-driven world, organizations generate massive amounts of data every day. Without proper visualization, this data can be overwhelming and difficult to interpret. Data visualization simplifies complex datasets and helps stakeholders make informed decisions quickly.</p>
        <p>Visual representations also improve communication by allowing technical and non-technical audiences to understand insights easily. Well-designed visualizations reduce confusion, highlight key findings, and support storytelling with data.</p>
