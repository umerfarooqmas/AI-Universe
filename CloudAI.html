        <h2>Overview of Cloud AI</h2>
        <p>
          Cloud AI refers to the deployment of AI models and services over the cloud, allowing businesses and developers 
          to leverage AI without needing to build the infrastructure from scratch. With Cloud AI, AI models are hosted 
          and executed on cloud platforms, providing users with access to computing resources, data storage, and AI tools 
          via the internet. This democratizes AI by making it more accessible to small businesses and individual developers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cloud AI offers scalable, cost-effective solutions for deploying machine learning models, processing vast amounts 
          of data, and running deep learning algorithms, all while reducing the need for powerful on-premise hardware. 
          Major cloud service providers such as AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure provide AI as a service, 
          including pre-trained models and tools for custom model creation.
