    <h1>Reinforcement Learning</h1>
    <p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties, and improving its actions over time.</p>

        <h2>What is Reinforcement Learning?</h2>
        <p>Reinforcement Learning is a branch of machine learning that focuses on training agents to take actions in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards. Unlike supervised learning, RL does not rely on labeled input-output pairs; instead, the agent learns by trial and error, gradually improving its decision-making strategy.</p>
        <p>At the core of RL is the concept of the agent, environment, states, actions, and rewards. The agent observes the state of the environment, selects an action, and receives a reward or penalty based on that action. Over time, the agent aims to learn a policy—a mapping from states to actions—that maximizes long-term rewards.</p>

    <section>
      <article>
        <h2>Key Concepts in Reinforcement Learning</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Agent:</strong> The learner or decision-maker.</li>
          <li><strong>Environment:</strong> The world in which the agent operates.</li>
          <li><strong>State:</strong> A representation of the current situation of the environment.</li>
          <li><strong>Action:</strong> A choice made by the agent that affects the environment.</li>
          <li><strong>Reward:</strong> Feedback from the environment used to evaluate the action.</li>
          <li><strong>Policy:</strong> A strategy that defines the agent's actions in each state.</li>
          <li><strong>Value Function:</strong> A prediction of future rewards from a given state or state-action pair.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These concepts allow reinforcement learning algorithms to optimize behavior through repeated interactions with the environment.</p>
