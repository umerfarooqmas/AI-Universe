    <h1>Welcome to the Machine Learning</h1>
    <p>Machine Learning (ML) is a field of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.</p>

        <h2>What is Machine Learning?</h2>
        <p>Machine Learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that empowers computers to improve their performance on a task over time without direct programming. Instead of relying on explicit instructions, ML systems learn patterns from historical data to make predictions or decisions. This makes ML ideal for tasks where traditional programming would be difficult or inefficient, such as image recognition, speech analysis, and predictive modeling.</p>
        <p>ML involves training a model using a dataset, then using that model to make predictions or decisions. The learning process can be supervised, unsupervised, or reinforced, depending on the task at hand and the nature of the data.</p>

    <section>
      <article>
        <h2>Types of Machine Learning</h2>
        <p>Machine Learning can be classified into three main types based on the learning process:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> In supervised learning, the model is trained on labeled data, meaning the input data is paired with the correct output. The goal is for the model to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs, making it capable of predicting outcomes for new, unseen data. Common algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, and support vector machines (SVM).</li>
          <li><strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> In unsupervised learning, the model is provided with unlabeled data and must find patterns or structures within it. Common tasks include clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection. Algorithms such as k-means clustering and principal component analysis (PCA) are used in unsupervised learning.</li>
          <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns by interacting with an environment. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, which it uses to improve its decision-making process over time. This approach is commonly used in areas like robotics, gaming, and self-driving cars.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each of these types of machine learning has its strengths and applications, and often, a combination of these techniques is used in real-world applications.</p>

        <h2>Applications of Machine Learning</h2>
        <p>Machine learning is transforming industries across the globe. Here are some prominent applications:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> ML algorithms are used for disease prediction, medical imaging analysis, and drug discovery. They can help in diagnosing diseases such as cancer, heart conditions, and neurological disorders by analyzing medical images or patient records.</li>
          <li><strong>Finance:</strong> In finance, ML is used for algorithmic trading, credit scoring, fraud detection, and risk management. Banks and financial institutions rely on ML models to predict market trends and assess the risk of loans or investments.</li>
          <li><strong>Retail:</strong> ML is widely used in e-commerce for personalized product recommendations, inventory management, and pricing optimization. Platforms like Amazon and Netflix use ML to suggest items based on user behavior and preferences.</li>
          <li><strong>Autonomous Vehicles:</strong> Self-driving cars use ML models to interpret sensor data and make real-time decisions, such as navigating traffic or avoiding obstacles. Reinforcement learning and deep learning are often used in these systems.</li>
          <li><strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</strong> NLP uses ML to enable machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language. Applications include chatbots, sentiment analysis, and language translation systems.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The possibilities for ML are vast, and as the technology advances, we are likely to see even more innovative applications across various fields.</p>

        <h2>Common Machine Learning Algorithms</h2>
        <p>Several machine learning algorithms are commonly used to solve different types of problems. Some of the most popular ones include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Linear Regression:</strong> A fundamental algorithm used for predicting continuous values based on input variables. It’s often used in tasks such as house price prediction and sales forecasting.</li>
          <li><strong>Logistic Regression:</strong> Despite its name, logistic regression is used for binary classification tasks, such as spam email detection or predicting whether a customer will buy a product.</li>
          <li><strong>Decision Trees:</strong> These are used for both classification and regression tasks. A decision tree splits data based on feature values to make decisions or predictions, and it’s easy to interpret.</li>
          <li><strong>Random Forest:</strong> An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve performance. Random forests are used in classification and regression tasks and are known for their robustness and accuracy.</li>
          <li><strong>Support Vector Machines (SVM):</strong> SVMs are used for classification tasks, especially for high-dimensional data. They work by finding a hyperplane that best separates the classes in the dataset.</li>
          <li><strong>Neural Networks:</strong> Neural networks are inspired by the human brain and are used in deep learning tasks. They excel at tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These algorithms form the foundation of many machine learning systems and are used for a wide range of tasks.</p>
