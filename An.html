        <h2>What is Analytics?</h2>
        <p>
          Analytics refers to the systematic analysis of data using statistical, mathematical, and computational techniques. 
          It transforms raw data into useful information that organizations can use to make informed decisions. 
          Analytics involves collecting data, cleaning it, analyzing patterns, and presenting results in an understandable format.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike simple reporting, analytics goes deeper by identifying why something happened and what is likely to happen next. 
          Modern analytics often combines data visualization, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to uncover insights 
          that may not be obvious through manual analysis.
