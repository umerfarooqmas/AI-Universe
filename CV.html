        <h2>What is Computer Vision?</h2>
        <p>Computer Vision (CV) is the field of artificial intelligence (AI) that trains computers to interpret and make decisions based on visual information. Just as humans can recognize objects, people, and scenes, CV allows machines to do the same, enabling them to interact with the world visually.</p>
        <p>The field of computer vision involves teaching machines how to "see" and understand images and video. It includes tasks like image classification, object detection, motion analysis, and semantic segmentation. Machine learning, especially deep learning using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), is the backbone of modern computer vision systems.</p>

        <h2>Key Techniques in Computer Vision</h2>
        <p>Computer vision encompasses several key techniques that enable machines to understand visual data:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Image Classification:</strong> The process of categorizing an image into one of many classes (e.g., identifying an image as a cat, dog, or car).</li>
          <li><strong>Object Detection:</strong> Detecting and locating objects within an image or video. For instance, identifying people, cars, and traffic signs in street images.</li>
          <li><strong>Image Segmentation:</strong> Partitioning an image into distinct regions or segments, often used to separate different objects or areas within an image.</li>
          <li><strong>Optical Character Recognition (OCR):</strong> Extracting text from images, such as scanning documents and converting them into editable formats.</li>
          <li><strong>Facial Recognition:</strong> Identifying individuals based on facial features, widely used in security, social media, and retail applications.</li>
          <li><strong>Feature Matching:</strong> Identifying and matching key features or points across images for tasks like object tracking or image stitching.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Deep Learning in Computer Vision</h2>
        <p>Deep learning, particularly through the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has revolutionized computer vision. CNNs are a type of neural network designed specifically to process pixel data and learn hierarchical patterns from images.</p>
        <p>For example, in image classification tasks, CNNs start by detecting low-level features (such as edges or textures) and then build more complex representations (shapes, objects) in deeper layers. This ability to automatically learn features has made CNNs the backbone of many state-of-the-art computer vision systems.</p>
        <p>Other advanced deep learning architectures like Faster R-CNN, YOLO (You Only Look Once), and RetinaNet are widely used for tasks like real-time object detection and segmentation.</p>
