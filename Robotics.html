        <h2>What is Robotics?</h2>
        <p>Robotics is the science and technology behind the design, construction, and use of robots. A robot is a machine that can be programmed to perform a range of tasks, from simple repetitive functions to complex, decision-making processes. Robotics is at the intersection of several fields, including mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science, and AI. Robots are designed to carry out tasks that are either too dangerous, repetitive, or complex for humans to perform efficiently.</p>
        <p>Robots can be autonomous (working on their own), semi-autonomous (working with human intervention), or teleoperated (controlled remotely). Robotics has applications in various industries, including manufacturing, healthcare, logistics, and entertainment.</p>

      <article>
        <h2>Types of Robots</h2>
        <p>Robots come in many different forms, depending on the task they are designed to perform. Some common types of robots include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Industrial Robots:</strong> These are robots designed for manufacturing and production tasks, such as assembly lines, welding, and packaging. They are often used in industries like automotive manufacturing.</li>
          <li><strong>Service Robots:</strong> These robots assist humans in a variety of services, including healthcare (robotic surgery, patient care), hospitality (robotic waiters), and domestic tasks (robotic vacuum cleaners).</li>
          <li><strong>Mobile Robots:</strong> Mobile robots, including autonomous vehicles (self-driving cars, drones), are capable of moving and navigating in different environments. They are used in sectors like delivery, military, and search and rescue missions.</li>
          <li><strong>Humanoid Robots:</strong> These robots are designed to resemble humans in appearance and behavior. Examples include robots like ASIMO and Atlas, which can walk, talk, and interact with humans in a more natural way.</li>
          <li><strong>Swarm Robots:</strong> These are groups of simple robots that work together to perform complex tasks. Swarm robotics is inspired by nature, particularly the behavior of social insects like ants and bees, which work in coordination to accomplish collective goals.</li>
        </ul>

      <article>
        <h2>Key Technologies in Robotics</h2>
        <p>Several technologies are fundamental to the field of robotics. These include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI):</strong> AI plays a crucial role in enabling robots to make decisions, recognize objects, and interact with their environment. Machine learning algorithms and deep learning networks help robots understand and process complex data, allowing them to adapt to new situations.</li>
          <li><strong>Computer Vision:</strong> Computer vision enables robots to "see" and interpret the world around them. Using cameras and sensors, robots can detect objects, navigate environments, and interact with humans more effectively.</li>
          <li><strong>Robotic Sensors:</strong> Sensors are critical for robots to perceive their environment. These include proximity sensors, cameras, accelerometers, gyroscopes, and force sensors, all of which allow the robot to gather data and adjust its actions accordingly.</li>
          <li><strong>Actuators and Motors:</strong> Actuators and motors are the "muscles" of a robot. They enable movement by converting electrical energy into mechanical movement. Servos, electric motors, and hydraulic systems are commonly used for robotic motion.</li>
          <li><strong>Localization and Navigation:</strong> Robots need to know their position in space and navigate to desired locations. Localization algorithms, such as SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), are used to map and navigate environments autonomously.</li>
        </ul>
