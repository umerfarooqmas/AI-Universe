        <h2>What is Big Data?</h2>
        <p>Big data is a term used to describe datasets that are too large or complex to be processed by traditional data-processing tools. These datasets can come from a variety of sources and can include structured data (like numbers or dates) as well as unstructured data (like text, images, or videos). Big data is often defined by the "Three Vs": Volume, Velocity, and Variety.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Volume:</strong> Refers to the massive amount of data generated every day, ranging from terabytes to petabytes.</li>
          <li><strong>Velocity:</strong> The speed at which data is generated and processed, often in real-time or near real-time.</li>
          <li><strong>Variety:</strong> The different types of data that are generated, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By analyzing big data, organizations can gain valuable insights that help them make better decisions, improve business operations, and enhance customer experiences.</p>
