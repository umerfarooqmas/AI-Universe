    <h1>Welcome to Generative AI</h1>
    <p>Generative AI is a branch of artificial intelligence that creates new content, including text, images, audio, and videos, by learning patterns from existing data.</p>

        <h2>What is Generative AI?</h2>
        <p>Generative AI refers to AI systems that can generate new data resembling the examples they were trained on. Unlike traditional AI, which focuses on recognizing patterns or making predictions, generative AI can create entirely new content. By leveraging large datasets and advanced algorithms, these systems learn the underlying structure and patterns in data, allowing them to produce realistic outputs such as images, music, or even computer code.</p>
        <p>Popular approaches include deep learning models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). These models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in creating high-quality, human-like content across multiple domains.</p>

    <!-- Key Techniques -->
    <section>
      <article>
        <h2>Key Techniques in Generative AI</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):</strong> GANs consist of a generator and a discriminator, which compete to produce increasingly realistic data, widely used for image and video generation.</li>
          <li><strong>Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):</strong> VAEs encode data into a latent space and then decode it, allowing for the creation of new data samples that resemble the original dataset.</li>
          <li><strong>Transformers and Large Language Models:</strong> Models like GPT generate human-like text and can be adapted for translation, summarization, code generation, and content creation.</li>
          <li><strong>Diffusion Models:</strong> These models gradually transform noise into structured output, especially used in image generation like DALL·E or Stable Diffusion.</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- Ethical Considerations -->
    <section>
      <article>
        <h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>
        <p>While Generative AI offers immense potential, it also raises ethical concerns:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Deepfakes:</strong> AI-generated videos or audio that impersonate real people can be misused for misinformation or fraud.</li>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Property:</strong> AI-generated content may infringe on copyrights or ownership of original works.</li>
          <li><strong>Bias and Fairness:</strong> AI models can inherit biases from the training data, producing outputs that reflect stereotypes or discriminatory patterns.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Addressing these challenges requires careful governance, transparency, and responsible AI practices.</p>
